# Exmap

## Description

Exmap is a Python package with allows users to generate maps based on an interpretable machine learning prediction. The current version of the package supports interpretation of the popular gradient boosting algorithm implementation [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io).

The interpretations under the hood are achieved by using [LIME](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime), and the maps are generated by using [Folium](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium) (a Python based wrapper for Leaflet.js).

Below you can have a look at am example generated map (based on the 2016 US Elections):
